## 📘 About this Course
This repository contains my work, labs, and projects from the **IBM Machine Learning with Python** course, part of the **IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate** on Coursera.  

The course covered the **end-to-end machine learning workflow**, from supervised and unsupervised learning to pipelines, evaluation, and real-world applications.
